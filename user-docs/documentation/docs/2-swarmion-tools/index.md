# Swarmion tools

In order to manage a scalable codebase, Swarmion comes with state of the art tooling for a Typescript monorepo. In this section, you'll learn why we chose each one, and what is important to know about them.

The main philosophy is to allow easy customization of the different tools used in the packages, without having to write too much code. Every tool can be configured at the root level and extended through composition at the package level.

## Main features

- [Yarn 3 with workspaces](./yarn-3-workspaces)
- [Nx](./nx)
- [Eslint configuration](./eslint)
- [Jest configuration](./jest)
- [End-to-end Typescript](./typescript)
- [Shared Typescript libraries built with babel](./shared-typescript-libraries)
- [VSCode native support](./vscode)
- Serverless contracts: please see [the dedicated section](../serverless-contracts/)
- Generators: please see [the dedicated section](../../how-to/use-swarmion-generators)
