# Migrate to Swarmion

Swarmion may seem like a fine match if you're starting a new project, but what if you already have an existing project?

In this section we'll present a few migration paths to use the awesome features of Swarmion on your project!

_For the moment this section is quite empty, but you can contact us at [contact@swarmion.dev](mailto:contact@swarmion.dev)._
