# Use Serverless contracts

Serverless contracts are a central point of Swarmion.

For the moment there are only two types of contracts available:

- [Api Gateway contracts](./api-gateway)
- [CloudFormation contracts](./cloudformation)

If you want to learn more about the motivation for using Serverless contracts, please check out [the contracts explanation](../../docs/serverless-contracts/)

We will continue to add new types of contracts, stay tuned!
